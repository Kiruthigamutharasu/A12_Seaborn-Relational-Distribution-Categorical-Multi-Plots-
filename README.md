Description
-----------
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis using Seaborn visualization library.  
The objective is to understand different types of Seaborn plots including:

- Relational Plots  
- Distribution Plots  
- Categorical Plots  
- Regression Plots  
- Matrix Plots  
- Faceting and Multi-Plots  

The same dataset has been used for all visualization tasks as per assignment requirements.
